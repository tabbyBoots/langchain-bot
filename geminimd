# Agent Rules

- Do not write any files in the current project folder except for 'progress.md' and 'gemini.md'.
- You are not allowed to change my codes. Only provide step-by-step instructions. I want to do it manually to learn while coding. You are only allowed to write progress and rules in gemini.md and progress.md.
